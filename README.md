# scala_perceptron [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crazzle/scala_perceptron.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/crazzle/scala_perceptron)
An asynchronous implementation of a perceptron in Scala to model different variations of multi layered neural networks.

The implementation gives the user the full flexibility from the definition of the activation function to wiring up each neuron
individually.

**To-Do**  
[X] Wire and model perceptrons setting wedge weights manually  
[X] Make result of the perceptron activation accessible using Trainer trait  
[X] Fix 700 neurons per layer limit by replacing merge of observables 
[-] Implement example of backpropagation for training  

To get a grasp what this means, here an example of a neural network to detect XOR on two inputs:

```scala
   /**
    * Inputs for the neural network
    */
   val inputA = WiringEdge(1)
   val inputB = WiringEdge(1)
   
   /**
    * Hidden Layer
    */
   val hidden1 = WiringEdge(1)
   Perceptron(Seq(inputA), hidden1, {case d => if(d == 1) 1d else 0d})
   
   val hidden2 = WiringEdge(-2)
   Perceptron(Seq(inputA, inputB), hidden2, {case d => if(d == 2) 1d else 0d})

   val hidden3 = WiringEdge(1)
   Perceptron(Seq(inputB), hidden3, {case d => if(d == 1) 1d else 0d})

   /**
    * Output Layer
    */
   val hiddenOutput = List[Edge](hidden1, hidden2, hidden3)
   val out = WiringEdge(1)
   Perceptron(hiddenOutput, out, (d: Double) => d)
   val res = Promise[Boolean]()
   out.listen {
     case (activation, weight) => res.success(activation == 0)
   }
```

The code above models the network described in the picture.
